## Guiding principle: do it the Wolverine way

This is a community Wolverine transport, so it should look and behave like a native one. The default for
any design question is **how does Wolverine itself do it** — the full Wolverine source is cloned locally
(machine-specific path), so tracing the real implementation (Kafka primary, Azure Service Bus
secondary) is the basis for resolving indecision, not guesswork. **Caveat:** the clone tracks `main` and
can be ahead of the pinned package (currently **WolverineFx 6.12.0**) — confirm an API exists in the
pinned version before relying on it (e.g. `DescribeEndpoint` / `IReportReceiveLoopHealth` are main-only,
which blocked Phase 6). Where the port strays from Wolverine's
conventions or doesn't fully implement what Wolverine expects, the rule is: **implement it Wolverine's
way, or document why we aren't/can't** — and capture it under "Divergences & gaps" below.

This extends to **code shape, not just behavior**: prefer mirroring the reference transport's *structure*
(Kafka primary) — how listeners are constructed, where config lives, how pieces are wired — so the
implementation **reads** like a Wolverine transport, not merely behaves like one. Structural gaps that
aren't conformance issues go under "Cleanups / tech-debt".

## 23. Topic-listener liveness: an unbounded `IReplayIdRepository` call can wedge the read loop deaf (first volume soak)
- **Date:** 2026-07-07 · **Status:** **Resolved** (same day — two-layer fix, red-first per the fix
  direction below; evidence log: `docs/test-results/overnight-inline-13h-win.txt`)
- **Resolution:** (1) **The read loop and completion path no longer touch the write at all** —
  `ReplayCommitTracker` hands positions to a latest-wins **single-flight writer** (`ScheduleLocked` /
  `WriteLoopAsync`); `CompleteAsync`/`ObserveKeepAliveAsync` return immediately, positions coalesce
  exactly as the throttle already coalesced them, and `FlushAsync` still genuinely awaits the drain
  (bounded by the listener's existing 5s). This subsumes fix-direction #2 and structurally removes the
  #22 in-instance reorder race (one writer = sequential writes; the monotonic guard stays as belt).
  (2) **Every consumer-repository touchpoint is bounded** by a new transport-owned
  `RepositoryCallTimeout` (default 30s): the listener wraps `transport.CommitAsync` (the token cancels
  cooperative implementations; `WaitAsync` abandons black-holed ones — the soak's half-open TCP writes
  ignored everything), logging timeouts at Warning; `ClientManagedReplayTransport` bounds
  `GetLastReplayIdAsync` and `ResetForNewEventsOnlyAsync`, whose timeouts throw into the reconnect
  loop's normal backoff. The writer therefore recovers from a hang and durable commits resume — the
  soak's proven absorb-and-retry path, now time-bounded instead of at TCP's mercy. Watchdog escalation
  (fix-direction #3) was **considered and deferred**: with the loop decoupled and every dependency call
  bounded, this wedge class is eliminated; the watchdog stays detection-only for unknown-unknowns.
  Pinned red-first in the #22 harness (`HangCommits`: a never-completing commit wedged the completion
  path in 2s exactly as observed live): loop liveness, prompt completions, bounded shutdown, and writer
  recovery once the repository heals. Tracker tests gained explicit writer-drain awaits (the
  single-flight writer made commit recording asynchronous).
- **Context:** Overnight soak (all five WIT subscriptions Inline, publisher both events every 60s,
  815 published each, SQL replay store over VPN). At 05:14 the VPN dropped — severing only the route to
  the SQL replay store; Salesforce connectivity was unaffected (the REST publisher and both MES listeners,
  which have no repository dependency, ran clean to the last minute — MES ledger even slightly over par
  from at-least-once redeliveries). The established pooled `SqlClient` connections **black-holed**
  (half-open TCP: writes sat in retransmit for 34–57+ minutes instead of failing) — while Wolverine's own
  durability agent against the *same server* failed fast all night because its polling kept opening fresh
  connections (~15s connect timeout). Each topic listener wedged inside the hung repository call: the
  commit is awaited on the response path, so the read loop blocked — no further `FetchRequest`s, hence no
  responses, not even keep-alives; the 270s idle-timeout wrapper never fired because it guards only
  `MoveNext` and the loop wasn't in `MoveNext`; nothing threw, so the reconnect loop never engaged.
  "Never throws out" held — this is a **liveness** failure, not a fault-out. When the first hang finally
  errored (chn 05:49:42; A/B topics 06:21:43/58) the designed path worked exactly as built: "Replay
  commit failed; will retry on next commit" → reconnect → the backlog batch was received and handled —
  then the *next* commit hung again, this time until process kill 2h later. Net effect: each topic
  ~170 events undelivered (recoverable lag, not loss — the durable replay positions sit before the gap);
  the #15 watchdog fired at Error every minute for 2.5h, so the state was loudly alertable throughout.
  Earlier the same night, two transient network blips (22:52, 23:58) were recovered perfectly by the
  reconnect loop with zero ledger impact — the failure is specific to a *hanging* dependency, not a
  failing one.
- **Fix direction (for the implementing session):**
  1. **Bound every consumer-repository call** (`GetLastReplayIdAsync`, `Report…ResponseAsync`,
     `ResetForNewEventsOnlyAsync`) with a transport-owned timeout (linked CTS, ~30s). A timeout becomes an
     ordinary commit failure feeding the existing absorb-and-retry path — which the log proves works when
     the call *returns*. The transport must not trust a consumer implementation to be prompt, same
     philosophy as #22 not trusting it to be monotonic.
  2. Keep the read loop off the commit's critical path, or give the consume iteration a whole-loop
     deadline — the idle wrapper guarding only `MoveNext` is the gap that let this hang hide.
  3. Consider watchdog escalation: after N consecutive deaf polls, force transport teardown → reconnect,
     instead of log-only (turns the existing detection into self-healing).
  4. **Reproduce red-first in the #22 fake-transport unit harness**: a `CommitAsync` returning a
     never-completing `Task` should wedge the listener today exactly as observed live. Pin the fix with
     that test. (The TestHost `FaultInjectingReplayIdRepository` seam was removed in the pre-public
     cleanup; the unit harness is the right home for this anyway.)
- **Consequences (current state):** At-least-once held — the outage produced recoverable lag and
  duplicates, never loss. MES endpoints are structurally immune (server-side replay, no repo). Until
  fixed, the watchdog is the operational mitigation: its every-minute Error line is the page-someone
  signal, and a process restart fully recovers (topics resume from the last committed position and
  replay the gap). Ops guidance meanwhile: run the replay store on a connection path that fails fast
  rather than black-holes, or front it with a repository decorator that enforces its own timeout.

## 22. Replay commits are monotonic: a disposed listener loses write authority; the tracker's write gate drops stale positions
- **Date:** 2026-07-06 · **Status:** Accepted (resolves the "Stop/Dispose semantics" open gap below; also
  external-review findings #1/#2)
- **Context:** Two related regression paths could write a stale replay position over a newer one — never
  loss, but unearned duplicates on the next cold start. (a) **Cross-instance** (the documented open gap):
  in Wolverine's no-drain backpressure path (`MarkAsTooBusyAndStopReceivingAsync`, traced at V6.12.0:
  `StopAsync` → `DisposeAsync`, no drain), the old listener's receiver queue keeps completing envelopes
  and its topic commits go out-of-band to the repository — racing the replacement listener's newer
  commits on the same row. (b) **In-instance:** the tracker computes positions in order under its lock,
  but a caller can be preempted between compute and the write gate, so a staler position can be written
  last. Both were theory until this entry's test work: a new deterministic listener unit harness (scripted
  `ISubscriptionTransport` + a recording receiver whose completions the test hand-drives) reproduced (a)
  on demand — red without the fix, the first time the race was ever forced rather than observed.
- **Decision:** Two thin guards. (1) `SalesforceListener.DisposeAsync` revokes commit authority: a
  disposed listener still absorbs completions (in-memory watermark advances harmlessly) but never writes
  them out. Revocation happens at **dispose**, not stop, so the stop-and-drain path's beneficial
  drain-window commits are preserved (drain runs between `StopAsync` and `DisposeAsync`). (2) The
  tracker's write gate drops **strictly-older** positions; equal positions pass because the MES idle
  re-affirm deliberately re-sends the last committed position to reset the server's 1800s deadline.
- **Why:** The repository-contract alternative (require every consumer `IReplayIdRepository` to upsert
  monotonically) guards the same row but relies on every implementation getting it right; transport-side
  guards make the contract unnecessary. Revoking at stop instead of dispose was rejected — it would
  discard the drain-window commits that make graceful stops resume cleanly.
- **Consequences:** The stop→rebuild path can no longer regress the replay row; a dropped late commit
  just means the tail redelivers under at-least-once (and dedups under Durable). The Backpressure
  integration fact's monotonicity **observation is promoted to a hard assertion**. The listener gained
  its first CI-runnable unit coverage as a side effect: the fake-transport harness also pins
  drain-window commits, writer-side monotonicity under concurrent out-of-order completions, the MES
  equal-position re-affirm surviving the guard, and #8's resume-from-handled-watermark threading.

## 21. Never set the base `Endpoint.MessageType` — it force-decodes unmapped events on single-entry maps
- **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Status:** Accepted (bug found by the new integration suite on its first day)
- **Context:** `AddEventMapping` set the base `Endpoint.MessageType` when the map had exactly one entry
  ("diagnostics parity" from the #19 rework). Verified in the pinned 6.12.0: a non-null
  `Endpoint.MessageType` makes Wolverine attach a `MessageTypeRule` **incoming envelope rule** that
  unconditionally overwrites `envelope.MessageType` on every received envelope
  (`Endpoint.RulesForIncoming`) — clobbering the listener's per-event resolution. Concretely (observed
  live in the unmapped-event integration test): a channel endpoint mapping only `WitEventA` received a
  published `WIT_Event_B__e`; the resolver correctly flagged it unmapped and stamped the raw record name,
  then the rule overwrote the stamp and the foreign event was **decoded and handled as `WitEventA`**
  (structurally-compatible Avro payloads decode without error) instead of riding the missing-handler
  path. Multi-entry maps were unaffected (`MessageType` stayed null), which is why #16's live unmapped
  verification — done on a two-entry channel — never saw it. The test had also passed once by luck:
  Salesforce assigned two near-simultaneous publishes bus positions opposite to POST order, and the
  assertion raced ahead of the foreign event's arrival (the suite's publish helpers now space
  order-sensitive publishes).
- **Decision:** Never set the base `Endpoint.MessageType`. Per-event stamping in the listener is the one
  and only typing mechanism, for N=1 exactly like N>1 (#19's model, now actually enforced end to end).
- **Consequences:** Unmapped events on single-entry endpoints dead-letter properly instead of silently
  masquerading as the mapped type. Unit test pins `MessageType` null for single-entry maps; the
  integration suite's unmapped-event test is the live pin. Endpoint diagnostics lose the single-type
  display — a non-behavioral surface Wolverine reads for docs/telemetry only; acceptable.

## 20. Buffered mode characterized: at-most-once has BOTH a loss window and a duplicate window across restarts — documented, not "fixed"
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Status:** Accepted (documentation decision; no code change)
- **Context:** The last un-verified delivery mode. `BufferedInMemory` acks at receipt (Wolverine's
  `BufferedReceiver` completes before the handler runs — DECISIONS #2), and our replay commit is
  *throttled* (`commitEvery`/keep-alive/flush). Those two facts predict two opposite failure windows
  around a force-kill, neither previously observed. Both were staged live on the channel endpoint
  (evidence: `test-results/buffered-run{1,2,3}.txt`):
  - **Duplicate window:** events 3504109/3504110 were handled, the process was killed within seconds —
    before any durable commit — and the restart resumed behind and **re-handled both**. "At-most-once"
    Buffered produces duplicates across restarts whenever the kill beats the throttled commit.
  - **Loss window:** two slow-handler events were received (ack-at-receipt advanced the watermark),
    nine fast events pushed the throttle so the durable commit (3504118) landed **past** the
    still-running slows; the kill caught 3504114 mid-handler → the restart resumed after the commit and
    **3504114 was never delivered again**. Received-committed-unhandled = lost.
- **Decision:** Document, don't engineer around. Both windows are inherent to ack-at-receipt combined
  with any batched/throttled durable commit; "fixing" either means moving the ack after handling — which
  is exactly what Inline and Durable already are. Guidance (README matrix): use Buffered only where loss
  *and* duplication are both acceptable; otherwise Inline (at-least-once) or Durable (at-least-once with
  parallelism + DLQ).
- **Consequences:** The delivery-guarantee matrix in the README now states observed behavior per mode
  with evidence cited, and doubles as the spec for future integration tests. This closes the original
  "Layer B" testing item — Inline was covered by the resiliency campaign, Durable by its live pass and
  the night-1 overnight, and Buffered by this characterization (steady-state overnight to follow).
- **Addendum (2026-07-04) — steady-state overnight PASSED** (`test-results/z_long-run_buffered.txt`,
  19h on the WIT channel via the two-ECA credentials): 229 published = 229 handled, zero loss, zero
  duplicates, zero stream errors/reconnects; graceful shutdown committed the final position. Confirms
  the loss/duplicate windows open **only around kills** — steady-state Buffered is indistinguishable
  from exactly-once. (The only log noise was two transient Azure SQL blips against Wolverine's
  message-store agents, self-recovered, no effect on event flow.)

## 19. Multi-type-first: a transport carries multiple message types; single-type is the N=1 case, not a different kind
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Status:** Accepted (supersedes the registration surface of #16 and its addenda)
- **Context:** A design review of the channels work identified that multi-type support had been bolted
  onto the original one-message-per-transport model rather than replacing it: two decode paths (named map
  vs "decode everything as T"), map sealing, cardinality rules policing the border, and three entry
  points (`ListenToSalesforceTopic`/`ListenToSalesforceChannel`/`ListenToManagedSubscription`) implying a
  false third kind. The real taxonomy has two axes: **who manages replay** (MES vs client-managed — the
  only true kind split) and **how many event types the stream carries** (just the map's cardinality).
  The "decode everything as T" sugar was additionally rejected on explicitness grounds: it cannot
  pre-warm schemas (nothing to look up), and it silently force-decodes a drifted stream instead of the
  consumer declaring "this is the event."
- **Decision:** Two entry points split on the replay axis — `ListenToSalesforceTopic(path)` (accepts
  `/event/X__e` and `/event/X__chn`; **"Topic" over "Channel"** because the Pub/Sub API's own
  `topic_name` field and `GetTopic` RPC treat both as topics; a channel is the narrower SF term) and
  `ListenToManagedSubscription(name)`. Every event is declared `MapEvent<T>("Api_Name__e")` with the
  **API name required**; every event resolves per-schema at receive time; unknown names ride the
  missing-handler path. A single-event topic (`__e`) validates at startup that its one mapped name equals
  the path's last segment (a mismatch would dead-letter everything at runtime). Because every entry is
  named, **every endpoint pre-warms its schemas at startup — including MES** (previously impossible for
  the single-type MES form). Deleted: `ListenToSalesforceChannel`, the generic `ListenTo…<T>` and
  `(string, Type)` overloads, the unconditional decode path, sealing, the cross-suffix guards (redundant
  with map validation). Identical duplicate `MapEvent` registration stays idempotent; a conflicting type
  for a name throws.
- **Also in this rework (the review's fluent redesign):** `SalesforcePubSubConfiguration` →
  `SalesforcePubSubTransportExpression` (Wolverine's `KafkaTransportExpression` naming; cannot derive
  `BrokerExpression` — it is paired with `BrokerTransport` and a sender side we don't have);
  `UseReplayIdRepository<T>()` / `UseBackoffStrategy<T>()` register consumer implementations through the
  expression (`Services.Replace` over the in-memory/linear defaults) instead of bare container
  registrations; observability knobs grouped under `Heartbeat`/`Watchdog` sub-expressions
  (`.Heartbeat.Interval(…)`, `.Watchdog.Threshold(…)`, `.Level(…)`, `.Disable()`; watchdog
  `PollingInterval` now settable at transport level) at both transport and per-listener levels, replacing
  the flat setters; internal `StaleStream*` settings renamed `Watchdog*` to match; the listener gained an
  explicit `Start()` called by `BuildListenerAsync` (the SPI has no start method — built == listening —
  so the constructor no longer does work and the lifecycle line is visible at the wiring site, mirroring
  Kafka main's `BackgroundReceiveLoop.Start()`).
- **Why:** One model covers all scenarios including N=1; the deletions remove every border-policing rule
  and the trust-based decode; the consumer always states "this is the event." Breaking changes accepted
  (org-internal, pre-consumer).
- **Consequences:** Public surface: `UseSalesforcePubSub` → expression; two `ListenTo…` methods;
  `MapEvent<T>(name)`/`MapEvent(Type, name)`; grouped observability. **Addendum (same day):**
  `[SalesforcePlatformEvent("Api_Name__e")]` on the event type lets `MapEvent<T>()` omit the name at the
  registration site — the declaration moves to the type (names rarely change); an explicit name always
  wins over the attribute, and a type with neither fails fast. TestHost config is events[]-only
  (`messageType` field removed; `Channel` type value retained as a Topic alias). Unit tests 99 → 93 (the
  sealing/sugar/guard tests deleted with their subjects).

## 18. Envelope identity: one Salesforce event = one message identity; per-endpoint processing is Wolverine's native `MessageIdentity.IdAndDestination`
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The code review found `ResolveEnvelopeId`'s three derivation paths implemented *different*
  dedup semantics by accident: the normal path (SF event UUID, used verbatim) and the non-guid path
  (MD5 of the id) were unsalted, while the no-id fallback salted with the resource. Concretely: publish
  `Test_Event_One__e` once while durably subscribed to both its topic and a channel containing it — both
  endpoints build the same `Envelope.Id`, the durable inbox's id-only primary key rejects the second
  insert, and one endpoint's handler silently never runs (observed live in the Durable pass as
  `DuplicateIncomingEnvelopeException`). Whether that is "correct exactly-once" or "silent loss" is a
  question of intent the transport couldn't express. An opt-in resource-salt flag was designed, then
  **dropped** when we checked what Wolverine already offers: `DurabilitySettings.MessageIdentity`
  (default `IdOnly`; `IdAndDestination` documented by Wolverine precisely for "receiving the same message
  and processing separately in different external transport listening endpoints" — verified present in
  the pinned 6.12.0).
- **Decision:** All three derivation paths implement **one unsalted semantic — one Salesforce event, one
  message identity**: guid passthrough; MD5 of a non-guid id; MD5 of the bare replay id when no id exists
  (valid as a global identity because replay ids are positions in the org's single shared event bus, so
  the same event carries the same replay id on every topic/channel/MES). No transport-level salt knob:
  consumers wanting independent per-endpoint processing of a fanned-out event set Wolverine's native
  `opts.Durability.MessageIdentity = MessageIdentity.IdAndDestination`.
- **Why:** The same event on multiple endpoints usually indicates overlapping subscription setup, and
  dedup is the safer default (user call); the deliberate-fan-out case shouldn't be foreclosed, and
  Wolverine already models exactly that choice — building our own salt would duplicate a native knob one
  layer down. Normalizing the fallback paths removes the accidental fork where dedup behavior depended on
  whether the event id happened to parse as a guid.
- **Consequences:** Dedup (like all identity semantics) only has teeth under **Durable** — Inline/Buffered
  have no store and process every delivery. The default cross-endpoint dedup is enforced by the inbox
  primary key and therefore *contingent on the app's `MessageIdentity` setting* — documented in the
  README so the semantic is chosen, not discovered. `IdAndDestination` is app-global (all transports) and
  changes the inbox PK shape (Wolverine migrates it). Supersedes #17's "fan-out caveat" framing.

## 17. Durable mode: schema strategy A (auth-hardened fetch-on-miss) + eager pre-warm; replay id persisted as a header
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** `EndpointMode.Durable` (at-least-once with parallelism + a real DLQ; without it a poison
  message is silently discarded, #10) was parked on the schema-on-recovery gap: the durable inbox persists
  raw Avro `Data`, and on restart the durability agent replays it with an **empty in-memory schema cache**
  (no listener pre-fetch ran) — the sync serializer would throw and every recovered event would dead-letter.
  Candidates: (A) async serializer with fetch-on-miss; (B) persist the schema JSON per envelope; (C) a
  durable schema table. Measured B live: a platform-event compact schema is **352 bytes** (scales ~100 B
  per field), and the inbox's `varbinary(max)` body column handles any size — B is affordable. **Rejected
  anyway on the Kafka precedent**: Wolverine's own `SchemaRegistryAvroSerializer` ships the schema as a
  persisted *pointer* (the Confluent wire-format id ≙ our `sfdc-schema-id` header) and its cached registry
  client fetch-on-misses over the network wherever decoding runs, including durable recovery — embedding
  the schema per message is the pattern that wire format exists to avoid. Schema evolution also demands
  fetch-by-id regardless: a recovered envelope must decode with the **writer's** schema id, which eager
  loading of the *current* schema cannot satisfy.
- **Decision:** (1) `supportsMode` allows `Durable`. (2) `SalesforceAvroSerializer : IAsyncMessageSerializer`
  (verified in the pinned 6.12.0): sync path stays cache-only; the async path fetch-on-misses by the
  persisted schema-id header **with the listener's auth contract** — an auth-rejected fetch calls
  `CachingAuthenticationTokenProvider.Invalidate()` and retries once with a fresh token (no revoked-token
  cache poisoning can dead-letter a whole recovery batch), then propagates to the durable DLQ (parked,
  replayable). (3) **Eager pre-warm** in the listener startup path: topic endpoints warm their own schema
  via GetTopic→GetSchema; channel/MES endpoints use the named `MapEvent` entries as the manifest — so
  recovery is a cache hit except for the startup race and schema evolution, which the fallback covers.
  (4) The event **replay id is persisted as an `sfdc-replay-id` header** — found live: `Envelope.Offset`
  is a runtime property the inbox does NOT round-trip, so recovered events decoded with `ReplayId 0`
  until the header was added (serializer prefers the header, falls back to Offset).
- **Why:** A is the Wolverine/Kafka-native shape adapted for Salesforce's shared event-bus token (Confluent
  registry clients carry independent credentials; our invalidate+retry supplies the equivalent recovery
  semantics). The hot path is untouched — the listener still pre-fetches in the consume loop, so the
  Phase-3 auth constraint (schema-fetch auth failures surface to the reconnect/invalidate path) holds.
- **Consequences:** Verified live on the sandbox org: restart-recovery (kill mid-handle → node reassignment (~90s)
  → inbox replay → decode → handled **with the real ReplayId**); poison message → moved to the durable
  dead-letter table (preserved, not discarded — closes #10's caveat); Wolverine auto-provisions its
  envelope storage. Consumer infra: a Wolverine message store (`WolverineFx.SqlServer` here) + note that
  Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 7.x needs `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.Extensions.Azure` for Entra auth.
  **Fan-out behavior:** superseded by #18 — one event = one message identity by design; durable endpoints
  dedup a fan-out under Wolverine's default `MessageIdentity.IdOnly`, and per-endpoint processing is
  Wolverine's native `IdAndDestination`.

## 16. Custom channels: map-only registration, per-event type resolution, missing-handler policy for unmapped events
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Accepted (resolves #14)
- **Context:** A custom channel (`/event/<Name>__chn`) delivers multiple event types on one stream; the
  one-`Type`-per-endpoint model would mis-decode. Per-event type identity comes only from each event's
  schema: **verified live (REST `eventSchema?payloadFormat=COMPACT` + gRPC `GetSchema`, identical): the
  Avro record top-level `name` is the full event API name including `__e`** (namespace
  `com.sforce.eventbus`) — the natural map key. Wolverine natively routes per-message via
  `envelope.MessageType` → `HandlerGraph.TryFindMessageType`; unknown names take `IMissingHandler`
  (dead-letter + log) and the envelope completes, so the replay watermark advances.
- **Decision:** **Map-only registration** (rejected Kafka's default+map: a catch-all default on a
  multi-type stream silently mis-decodes). Everything declares types via `MapEvent`; kind constrains
  cardinality — Topic `__e` exactly 1 (name optional), Channel `__chn` 1..N (all named), MES 1..N (its
  server-side channel may be a `__chn`; one unnamed entry = unconditional stamp). The `ListenTo…<T>`
  generics remain as sugar creating a **sealed** single-entry map — `.MapEvent` after sugar throws at
  startup, as do cardinality/suffix violations (`ListenToSalesforceTopic` rejects `__chn` and vice versa).
  Channels are **Topic-kind endpoints** (same Subscribe RPC, client-side replay, SQL store, watermark
  resume #8). The listener resolves each event via schema-id → memoized record name → map, stamping
  `MessageType` per event; the single-unconditional case skips parsing (exact pre-channel parity).
  **Unmapped events**: warn once per record name, stamp the raw record name, let Wolverine's
  missing-handler policy dead-letter it — which also makes `[MessageIdentity("Api_Name__e")]` on a handled
  type a zero-config opt-in.
- **Why:** Per-event stamping is Wolverine's own multi-type model; map-only keeps a multi-type stream's
  contract explicit at the registration site and eliminates the mis-decode foot-gun by construction. The
  same type may be mapped on multiple endpoints (Topic + Channel + MES) — handlers are type-routed,
  per-endpoint state is independent; `Envelope.TopicName` identifies the source.
- **Consequences:** Verified live on the sandbox org against `CM_Test_Channel__chn` (created via the sf CLI Tooling
  API): both test events decode to their mapped types off one stream; fan-out of one event to Topic +
  Channel fires the handler once per endpoint under Inline (see #17 for the Durable dedup); an unmapped
  event warns, dead-letters via the missing-handler path, and the watermark advances past it. New public
  surface: `ListenToSalesforceChannel`, non-generic `ListenToSalesforceTopic`/`ListenToManagedSubscription`
  overloads, `MapEvent<T>`/`MapEvent(Type, string?)`. Unit tests 63 → 94.
  **Post-review addenda (2026-07-03):** (a) `ListenToSalesforceTopic` rejecting `…__chn` resources is an
  **intentional breaking change** — the old path force-decoded every channel event into one type, which
  "worked" only for single-member channels and silently mis-decoded otherwise; migrate to
  `ListenToSalesforceChannel` + `MapEvent`. (b) Re-registering an *identical* mapping (same resource,
  same type) is idempotent per Wolverine convention; only a conflicting type throws. (c) A type-resolution
  failure (unparseable schema / eviction race) stamps a fallback name and rides the missing-handler path —
  the watermark can never be pinned by a bad schema. (d) A throwing consumer `IBackoffStrategy` degrades
  to a 15s fallback delay, and a faulted listener loop stops its heartbeat/watchdog sidecars and logs
  Critical (a dead endpoint must not look alive).

## 15. Listener heartbeat + silent-cold watchdog (observability port-back from the orchestrator)
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** During steady healthy running the listener logged nothing at Information (only
  start/stop/recovery), and at Warning — the operational default — it was fully silent: healthy-idle and
  silently-wedged were indistinguishable. Run-2's overnight incident made it concrete: a 21-minute MES
  outage surfaced only as repeated Warning-level `AlreadyExists` noise with no alertable Error. The
  operational model is **traces + logs, not OTEL metrics**, so the answer is log-based. The original
  `SubscriptionOrchestrator` had two periodic loops the Wolverine port dropped: a heartbeat
  (Info counters line every 15 min) and a silent-cold monitor (Error when nothing has been received for
  15 min — the "connected but delivering nothing" prod failure mode).
- **Decision:** Port both back into `SalesforceListener` as `PeriodicTimer` loops started/awaited by
  `RunAsync` (same never-throw-out discipline as the consume loop), with counters + trip logic in a new
  testable `Internals/ListenerDiagnostics` (lock-guarded; explicit timestamps). Wording of both log lines
  matches the old orchestrator. Config follows the Phase-4 pattern — transport-level defaults with
  per-endpoint overrides: `HeartbeatInterval` (15 min) + `HeartbeatLogLevel` (Information),
  `StaleStreamThreshold` (15 min) + `StaleStreamLogLevel` (Error), watchdog polling period internal
  (1 min). `TimeSpan.Zero` disables; explicit `DisableHeartbeat()` / `DisableStaleStreamWatchdog()`
  fluent methods for discoverability. The watchdog deliberately logs **every poll** while the stream
  stays cold (alert-friendly), and the reconnect-failure log **escalates Warning → `StaleStreamLogLevel`**
  once past the same threshold (restoring the orchestrator's escalation, but tied to the configured
  threshold instead of its hardcoded 30 min) — one knob governs alert severity for both signals.
- **Why:** The watchdog turns a wedged stream into an alertable Error instead of Warning noise; the
  heartbeat makes healthy-idle visibly alive. Keep-alives arrive ~every 2 min and stamp last-success, so
  the 15-min threshold only trips on a genuinely cold stream — it complements the 270s `FetchTimeout`
  reconnect (which handles idle-timeout) rather than overlapping it. Library-level because the listener
  is the orchestrator's equivalent (per-resource counters/loops live with the stream they observe).
- **Consequences / divergences from the old code:** `Reconnects` now counts actual **recoveries** (one
  per error streak) rather than being incremented on every error alongside `TotalErrors` (the old
  counter was a duplicate). Log levels are configurable (old: fixed). Unit tests 63 (was 46). TestHost
  gained per-subscription `heartbeatInterval` / `staleStreamThreshold` knobs for live verification.

## 14. Custom channels (multi-type streams) — design holistically with Durable mode + a unified registration surface
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Resolved — implemented by #16 (channels/registration) + #17 (Durable/schema strategy)
- **Context:** Salesforce **custom channels** (`/event/<Name>__chn`, created via `PlatformEventChannel` +
  `PlatformEventChannelMember` Tooling/Metadata API) group **multiple custom platform events** into one stream
  (custom high-volume PEs + Real-Time Event Monitoring only; standard PEs excluded; one event product per channel).
  A single subscription therefore delivers **heterogeneous event types**. Type is identified **per event** via its
  **schema id → `GetSchema` → `schema_json` (event API name)** — the `EventApiName` header is **not** available to
  Pub/Sub API subscribers (CometD only), so the schema is the only source of the type. This breaks the transport's
  current **one-`Type`-per-endpoint** assumption: `ListenToSalesforceTopic<T>` binds a single type, the listener
  stamps that fixed `envelope.MessageType`, and `SalesforceAvroSerializer.ReadFromData(messageType, …)`
  force-decodes every event into it → mis-decode on a multi-type channel.
- **Direction (not final; deferred):**
  1. **Per-event type resolution.** Resolve each event's .NET type from its schema (schema record name = event API
     name → a registered Type map) and stamp `envelope.MessageType` **per event** in the listener (where the schema
     is already pre-fetched in the loop). Wolverine then routes by type to the right handler — its native
     multi-type-per-endpoint model (like Kafka). The **serializer needs no change** (already type-parameterized);
     the work is in the binding + the listener's resolution step + an unmapped-type policy (skip/dead-letter/warn).
  2. **Co-design with the parked Durable-mode serializer gap (divergences list "No Durable mode").** They share the
     same fault line: **schema availability outside the listener pre-fetch.** Type resolution is a *receive-time*
     concern (schema is pre-fetched; the resolved type persists in `envelope.MessageType`), so recovery routing is
     fine — but the **decode on Durable restart-recovery still needs the schema by id**, which is exactly the parked
     gap (candidates A: async serializer w/ fetch-on-miss; B: persist schema JSON in a header; C: durable schema
     table). Custom channels make the schema-on-recovery path load-bearing for *more* of the flow, so **do not solve
     Durable's serializer in isolation** — pick a schema strategy that serves single-topic, multi-type channel, and
     Durable recovery together.
  3. **Unified registration surface (per user: don't bolt channels on).** Rework the fluent registration
     holistically so **single-topic (one type), custom channel (many types), and MES** share one coherent model —
     the single-topic case being the simplest form of the general shape, not a separate API with channels grafted
     on. Revisit `ListenToSalesforceTopic[<T>]` / `ListenToManagedSubscription[<T>]` as a whole. Open question for
     the mapping key: explicit `.Route<T>("Api_Name__e")` vs an attribute on the event type
     (`[SalesforcePlatformEvent("Api_Name__e")]`) vs convention.
- **Confirm before building:** the exact `schema_json` field that yields the event API name (Avro record `name`
  vs namespace/fullname) — drives the map key — verified against a real channel schema.
- **Why deferred:** it's a capability addition entangled with two in-flight design areas (Durable serializer,
  registration shape); capturing the constraints now prevents a piecemeal serializer/registration redesign later.
- **Scope:** primarily the **Topic** path (channels subscribe via `Subscribe` with `topic_name=/event/<Name>__chn`)
  — aligns with #13 (Topic is target). A `ManagedEventSubscription` can also reference a channel (secondary per #13).

## 13. MES has no slot force-release; Topic is the target transport (esp. prod), MES supported but secondary
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** A MES subscription slot is exclusive per client (*"A managed subscription is unique per client and
  can't be shared with other clients for the same Salesforce org"*). When Salesforce **does not observe a clean
  TCP teardown** — a **network partition / half-open socket** (WiFi drop, edge/LB reset) — it keeps the slot
  "active" until an internal, **undocumented** timeout (**~15 min observed**), so every reconnect returns
  `sfdc.platform.eventbus.grpc.managed.subscription.already.active` (`ALREADY_EXISTS`) until it expires. The app
  that *owns* the subscription has no way to reclaim its own slot. Confirmed there is **no force-release**: the
  proto exposes only `ManagedSubscribe` (no unsubscribe/release/disconnect RPC), and the docs offer only *"there
  can be a delay before it expires. Try subscribing again later."* The one lifecycle lever — the
  `ManagedEventSubscription` `state` RUN/STOP field (Tooling/Metadata API) — is **not** a usable fast-release:
  STOP→RUN carries a *"wait a few minutes"* config-propagation delay, so it's slower and more fragile than just
  waiting out the slot. Observed live: MES #1 (clean half-close → slot released <15s); run-2 overnight **network**
  reset (half-open → ~15-min `AlreadyExists` cascade → recovery, no loss); MES #6+#8 **local force-kill → restart**
  (OS closes the sockets → server sees a clean teardown → **slot released in seconds, NO `AlreadyExists`**, resumed
  from checkpoint, 1-event dup of the uncommitted tail, no loss). **Refined rule: the ~15-min hold requires the
  server to NOT observe a clean close (network partition / half-open). A local process crash/SIGKILL closes the
  sockets, so it recovers in seconds like a graceful stop** — the crash-recovery cost is narrower than first
  feared (most pod terminations recover fast; only a true network partition incurs the ~15-min gap). The org has
  independently hit MES quirks in prod and already moved those workloads to Topics.
- **Decision:** **Topic is the target transport, especially in prod.** Topics use client-side replay (our SQL
  `IReplayIdRepository`, already built) — no server slot, no exclusivity, no `AlreadyExists` → **instant reconnect
  on any failure, clean or dirty.** MES remains **supported and tested** but is **secondary**: use it only where
  the ~15-min unclean-recovery window is tolerable *and* SF-managed replay checkpointing is specifically wanted.
  Lifecycle management: (a) keep every *voluntary* disconnect clean — the transport already half-closes
  (`TryCompleteAsync`) on graceful stop and on error handling, which is why clean drops release fast; audit that
  all stream-abandon paths half-close first while the socket is alive; (b) accept that **hard network loss is
  irreducible** (can't half-close a dead socket → ~15-min hold, no client remedy).
- **Why:** No force-release exists and none can be built client-side — SF owns the slot expiry. Given that, the
  only real lever is transport choice, and Topics eliminate the failure mode entirely at the cost of a
  client-side replay store we already have. MES's sole advantage (SF manages the checkpoint) isn't worth a
  15-min recovery cliff for anything latency- or availability-sensitive.
- **Consequences / options not taken:** Documented so consumers pick transport by recovery tolerance. A
  **dual-developer-name MES failover** (two slots on one channel, fail over to the un-held slot on `AlreadyExists`)
  was considered as an escape hatch for "MES + fast recovery" but **not adopted** — 2× config plus server-checkpoint
  reconciliation (bounded redelivery) is complexity only justified if Topics genuinely can't be used. One smaller
  follow-up remains open: the observability watchdog (surface a stuck MES as an alertable Error instead of
  Warning noise). An `AlreadyExists`-aware longer backoff was considered and **dropped** (2026-07-02): run-2
  showed the real incident is the ~15-min slot hold, which no backoff tuning shortens — it would only reduce log
  noise in the sub-15s clean-close race, which already self-heals in one retry.

## 12. MES re-affirms its replay commit on idle keep-alives (server 1800s no-commit deadline)
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The ~4.5h idle baseline (`test-results/z_long-run-1.txt`, topic + MES both on, publisher off)
  surfaced a recurring MES-only cycle every ~30 min: `RpcException DeadlineExceeded: "No CommitReplayRequests
  sent in the last 1800 seconds. Closing managed subscription."` → the immediate 0-backoff reconnect on the
  first error raced Salesforce's slot teardown → `AlreadyExists` → 15s backoff → reconnect → repeat. Root
  cause (confirmed exactly by the log): the last MES commit was 15:32:41, first `DeadlineExceeded` at 16:02:41
  — precisely 1800s later. Replay commits are **watermark-driven** (`ReplayCommitTracker` commits only when the
  safe position *advances* past `_lastCommitted`). With no traffic the position never advances, so **no
  `CommitReplayRequest` is ever sent during idle**, and Salesforce closes a managed subscription that receives
  none within 1800s. Topic is immune (client-side commit, no server deadline). Real production impact: any
  idle or below-`commitEvery` low-volume MES subscription would churn (tear down + rebuild) every 30 min.
- **Decision:** MES re-affirms the last committed position on **each idle keep-alive**. `ReplayCommitTracker`
  gained `commitKeepAliveWhenIdle` (MES `true`, topic `false`, wired in `SalesforceListener` as
  `!resumesFromWatermark`); when a keep-alive produces no advance, it re-sends `_lastCommitted` (once something
  has been committed) to reset the server's deadline. MES keep-alives arrive ~every 2 min, comfortably inside
  1800s.
- **Why:** The re-affirm is safe — it re-sends a position the server already acknowledged, so it never
  regresses and never advances past an in-flight event (verified by test: with an event in flight, the
  keep-alive re-affirms the floor, not the tip). It requires no clock (keep-alive arrival is the natural
  cadence) and is scoped off for topic (which would otherwise re-write the repository pointlessly). Chose this
  over a dedicated commit-keepalive timer in the MES transport, which would have to independently commit the
  tip and could race past in-flight events (unsafe) — the watermark tracker is the only component that knows
  the safe position.
- **Consequences:** Fixes the 30-min teardown; the paired `AlreadyExists` disappears with it. Unit tests
  46 (was 43). **Residual (not addressed, benign):** on any *other* server-initiated MES close, the first
  reconnect (0s backoff) can still race the slot teardown for a single self-healing `AlreadyExists` (same as
  DECISIONS-observed in MES #1) — acceptable, rides the backoff. **Verified live (2026-07-02):** rerun idle
  baseline passed the 30-min mark with steady ~2-min MES keep-alive commits and zero `DeadlineExceeded`.

## 11. MES graceful-shutdown commit: flush before cancel + serialize stream writes
- **Date:** 2026-07-01 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The MES throwing-handler test showed the graceful-shutdown flush failing with
  `ObjectDisposedException`. `StopAsync` cancelled `_cts` — which aborts the MES gRPC call (created with that
  token) and disposes the transport — **before** calling `FlushAsync`, so the final `CommitReplayIdRequest`
  wrote to a dead stream. Topic was immune (it commits out-of-band to the repository). Separately, MES fetch
  requests and commits share one `RequestStream` and concurrent `WriteAsync` throws, so the flush could race
  an in-flight `RequestMore` — the "MES serialized writer" #2 anticipated but that wasn't wired.
- **Decision:** `StopAsync` flushes the final committable position **before** cancelling (bounded to 5s so a
  dead stream can't hang shutdown); `ManagedEventSubscriptionTransport` serializes **all** request-stream
  writes (fetch + commit) through a `_writeLock`.
- **Why:** MES commits on the gRPC stream, which cancellation aborts — the flush must run while the stream is
  live. The write lock stops the flush racing a fetch. The timeout means a dead stream degrades to
  at-least-once (the tail re-delivers on restart) instead of hanging shutdown.
- **Consequences:** Verified — a graceful MES shutdown now logs `Finished CommitReplayId` + `Committed replay
  position X` **before** the stream cancels, no `ObjectDisposedException`; the server records the final
  position so a restart doesn't redeliver the uncommitted tail. Topic unchanged (out-of-band SQL commit).

## 10. `DeferAsync` re-injects for an in-memory retry (Kafka precedent), not hold-idle or discard
- **Date:** 2026-07-01 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** `DeferAsync` was a no-op that left the envelope in flight, holding the replay watermark until a
  reconnect happened to re-deliver it. On a healthy long-running stream that reconnect may never come, so a
  deferred message was **never retried** and the watermark stalled — and a stalled watermark risks the
  committed replay id **aging out of Salesforce's 72h retention** (→ `InvalidArgument` → reset-to-Latest,
  losing far more than the one message) plus mass replay on the eventual reconnect. Investigated how
  Wolverine's own stream transports handle this: **Kafka's `DeferAsync` re-injects the envelope into the
  pipeline (`_receiver.ReceivedAsync(this, envelope)`) — an in-memory retry — without advancing the offset**
  (Pulsar: native redelivery or re-produce; queues re-send a copy — not applicable to a replay stream).
- **Decision:** Mirror Kafka — `DeferAsync` re-injects for an in-memory retry. The envelope was `Track`ed on
  first receive and is not re-tracked, so the watermark holds below it until it is finally resolved by
  `CompleteAsync`.
- **Why:** It honors "defer = try again", is the Wolverine-idiomatic behavior for an offset/replay stream,
  and — crucially — is **bounded** under Wolverine's default failure handling: an unconfigured handler
  exception requeues (Defer → re-inject) for `MaximumAttempts−1` (default **2**) attempts, then
  `MoveToErrorQueue` → `CompleteAsync`, so the watermark **always advances** and there is no aging/stall.
  The old no-op neither retried nor terminated. A stall now only happens under a deliberately *unbounded*
  requeue policy (a consumer misconfiguration Kafka shares).
- **Consequences / caveat:** In **Inline/BufferedInMemory with no durable store**, `MoveToErrorQueue` writes
  to the `NullMessageStore` (a **no-op**) and then `CompleteAsync`s anyway — so a poison message is retried,
  then **silently discarded** (lost) while the watermark advances. No exception, no loop, no stall, but the
  message is gone. **Preserving poison messages requires a durable store / real DLQ** — i.e. the Durable
  inbox work (aspirational, see the divergences list). The consumer's standard Wolverine error policies
  (`RetryTimes`, `MaximumAttempts`, `MoveToErrorQueue`, scheduled retry) govern the outcome, so no separate
  defer-policy interface is added (keeps the public surface minimal).

## 9. Never cache an incomplete / failed authentication token
- **Date:** 2026-07-01 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The Layer-A "OAuth disabled at startup" test wedged the listener **permanently** (even after
  OAuth was re-enabled). Root cause chain: the consumer token handler returned a response with a **null
  `AccessToken`** (the TestHost token client deserialized a `400 invalid_client` body instead of throwing);
  `CachingAuthenticationTokenProvider` only null-checked the *response object*, not its contents, so it
  **cached the null-token entry** for the full TTL; `AddCallCredentials` then threw `ArgumentNullException`
  on `metadata.Add(…, null)`, surfacing as `RpcException Internal` — **not** `Unauthenticated` — so the
  `Invalidate()` path never fired and the poisoned cache entry was never cleared.
- **Decision:** The provider **validates the token before caching** — if `AccessToken`/`InstanceUri`/
  `TenantId` is empty it throws and caches nothing. The TestHost token client also **fails loud** on a
  non-success token response instead of producing a null-token.
- **Why:** A failed/empty fetch must not poison the cache. Caching nothing means every reconnect re-fetches,
  so recovery is automatic once auth is restored — without relying on the invalidate path, which only
  covers a gRPC auth *rejection* of an already-cached token (#3). Complements #3: #3 clears a
  cached-but-revoked token; #9 ensures a never-valid token is never cached in the first place.
- **Consequences:** Verified — OAuth-disabled now yields a clear `token request failed (400 …)` error, a
  graceful backoff loop (no crash), and recovery on re-enable. Regression tests added (incomplete token
  throws and is not cached → recovers on the next valid fetch).

## 8. In-process reconnect resumes from the handled watermark, not the durable store
- **Date:** 2026-07-01 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** A topic reconnect (`TopicTransport.WriteFetchRequestAsync`) originally always resolved its
  resume position from `IReplayIdRepository.GetLastReplayIdAsync` — the last *durably-committed* replay
  id. Because commits are throttled (`commitEvery`, or an idle keep-alive), that position lags the
  actually-handled position by up to `commitEvery` events. The Layer-A **WiFi-death** test surfaced the
  effect: a reconnect redelivered every event handled since the last commit (7 duplicates in that run,
  because no commit had occurred pre-outage). Safe (at-least-once), but more redelivery than necessary.
- **Decision:** On an **in-process reconnect**, resume from the listener's in-memory *handled* watermark
  (`ReplayCommitTracker.TryGetResumePosition()` = lowest in-flight − 1, else high-water). A true **cold
  start** (fresh process — tracker empty → `null`) still reads the durable store. The value is threaded
  `tracker → listener → transport factory (Func<long?, ISubscriptionTransport>) → TopicTransport` and
  applied to the **initial** fetch only; `RequestMoreAsync` (mid-stream flow control) is unchanged. MES
  ignores it (server-side replay).
- **Why:** In-process we *know* which events were handled (`CompleteAsync` drove the watermark), so
  redelivering them on reconnect is wasteful. Resuming from the handled watermark eliminates reconnect
  duplicates while preserving at-least-once on a real restart (which reads the durable store, behind =
  safe). The resume anchor is the fully-handled watermark, not the raw received high-water, so in-flight
  (received-but-not-completed) events are still redelivered — no loss.
- **Consequences:** Verified on the WiFi-death rerun: reconnect resumed at the handled id, zero
  redelivery, contiguous ledger, no gap. The durable store can legitimately trail the in-memory position
  during a DB outage; the next successful commit writes the latest (monotonic) position and self-heals.

## 7. Inherited `ListenerConfiguration` serializer/encryption knobs left inert (no guard)
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Deriving from `ListenerConfiguration<,>` (see #5) inherits `DefaultSerializer`,
  `Encrypted`, `RequireEncryption`, and `MessageBatchSize`, which look inapplicable to this transport.
- **Decision:** Leave them inherited but treat them as inert; do **not** add a `RequireEncryption`
  guard.
- **Why:** The transport owns Avro deserialization and sets `envelope.Message` directly, bypassing
  Wolverine's inbound serialization pipeline. Verified in Wolverine source that the encryption gate
  lives inside `TryDeserializeEnvelope`, behind its `if (envelope.Message != null) return` short-circuit
  (`HandlerPipeline.cs`) — so for our pre-deserialized envelopes it never runs. These knobs are no-ops,
  not hazards. A guard would also require reflecting into Wolverine's deliberately-`internal`
  `RequiredEncryptedListenerUris`, fighting its design to guard nothing.
- **Consequences:** Document the inert knobs in XML docs. (Corrects an earlier in-session assumption
  that `RequireEncryption` would dead-letter events — it does not, for this transport.)

## 6. Per-message dispatch into Wolverine for now; batching deferred
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Status:** Deferred
- **Context:** Salesforce delivers events in batches (`FetchResponse.Events`, sized by `FetchCount`),
  and Wolverine's `IReceiver` exposes a batch overload (`ReceivedAsync(IListener, Envelope[])`).
- **Decision:** The listener decomposes each batch and calls the single-envelope `ReceivedAsync` in a
  loop, then acks the whole batch.
- **Why:** Simplest correct first cut. Batching is genuinely possible (both wire and Wolverine support
  it); it just wasn't wired up.
- **Consequences:** `MessageBatchSize` is inert today. Switching to the array overload is a future
  refinement that would also align dispatch with the batch-level replay ack.

## 5. `SalesforceListenerConfiguration` derives from Wolverine's `ListenerConfiguration<,>`
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The port shipped a hand-rolled sealed config class exposing only `ProcessInline()` /
  `BufferedInMemory()` — two methods that merely set one endpoint property.
- **Decision:** Derive from `ListenerConfiguration<SalesforceListenerConfiguration, SalesforceEndpoint>`
  and delete the hand-rolled methods (now inherited).
- **Why:** Match the Wolverine convention (Kafka/ASB do exactly this) so the surface "natively belongs"
  in Wolverine. The hand-rolled class re-implemented base methods by hand. Rejected the alternative of
  passing the mode into `ConfigureListener` as a parameter — Wolverine's idiom is fluent chaining, not
  parameters (`ListenToKafkaTopic` takes only the topic name).
- **Consequences:** Consumers get the standard listener surface for free. Unsupported modes are rejected
  by `supportsMode`; `ListenerCount` is guarded (see #4); serializer/encryption knobs are inert (see #7).

## 4. `ListenerCount` constrained to 1
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The inherited base exposes `ListenerCount(int)`. Wolverine's `ListeningAgent` builds that
  many parallel listeners.
- **Decision:** `SalesforceEndpoint.BuildListenerAsync` throws if `ListenerCount > 1`.
- **Why:** Each listener opens its own gRPC subscription to the same channel, so >1 means duplicate
  delivery and replay-id races. `supportsMode` doesn't cover it and `ListenerCount` isn't virtual, so a
  fail-fast guard at build time is the clean spot.
- **Consequences:** Misconfiguration fails at startup with a clear message instead of silently
  duplicating delivery.

## 3. Transport owns Salesforce token caching + invalidates on auth failure
- **Date:** 2026-06-24 · **Status:** Accepted · **Commit:** 35ceec2
- **Context:** Revoked-before-expiry tokens were a recurring production pain; a TTL-only cache (or a
  caching consumer handler) keeps re-handing the dead token on reconnect.
- **Decision:** `CachingAuthenticationTokenProvider` (singleton) owns caching (default 60 min, override
  via `SubscriberComponentsSettings.TokenCacheDuration`); `AddCallCredentials` resolves it; the listener
  calls `Invalidate()` on `RpcException` Unauthenticated/PermissionDenied before reconnecting.
  `IAuthenticationTokenHandler` must fetch fresh and not cache.
- **Why:** Centralizing cache + invalidation in the library is the only way to reliably recover from
  revocation; it also removes the burden from consumers. Kept `AddCallCredentials` (rejected inline
  credential attachment, "Option C" — more surface, no correctness gain).
- **Consequences:** Consumer handlers must not cache. TestHost bridge fetches with `refresh: true`.

## 2. Delivery guarantee: ship effective at-least-once (Inline); formal seam deferred
- **Date:** 2026-06-24 (implemented 2026-06-30, Phase 2) · **Status:** **Resolved (Phase 2)** for Inline at-least-once — per-envelope `ReplayCommitTracker` watermark; `CompleteAsync` advances the position, `DeferAsync` holds it; Topic + MES (MES commit serialized through the request stream); keep-alive advance + commit throttle + flush-on-stop; commits route to the current transport. **Buffered remains at-most-once** by design; parallel at-least-once via the durable inbox is the aspirational entry (built on this).
- **Context:** Replay is committed after the batch is dispatched; `CompleteAsync`/`DeferAsync` are no-ops.
- **Decision:** Ship with the default **Inline** mode, where `ReceivedAsync` runs the handler before the
  ack → effective at-least-once for the crash case (crash mid-batch ⇒ re-delivery). Defer the robust seam.
- **Scope when the seam IS built — no partial:** it must ship covering **Topic and MES together**, never
  a transport-only partial. A half-wired `IListener` ack contract (real on Topic, no-op on MES) silently
  differs by endpoint kind and is worse than today's honest no-op-on-both. The unit of work is: a shared
  per-envelope replay **watermark** (Kafka `KafkaOffsetCommitter`-style — `Track` on receive, advance
  only through successfully-handled events on `CompleteAsync`, hold on `DeferAsync`), a commit throttle,
  and the **MES serialized writer** (commits share the gRPC `RequestStream` with fetch requests, and
  concurrent `WriteAsync` throws).
- **Buffered stays at-most-once — by design; the seam does NOT change it.** `BufferedReceiver` calls
  `CompleteAsync` at *receipt* time (posts the complete-block right after enqueue, before the handler
  runs — `BufferedReceiver.cs:242`), so replay would advance when an event is buffered, not when handled.
  At-least-once is therefore inherently an **Inline** property. Documenting this is part of the scope,
  not something to implement for Buffered.
- **Current gap the seam also closes:** today a handler *failure* under Inline is swallowed by
  `InlineReceiver` (it calls our no-op `DeferAsync`) and the batch ack still advances past the failed
  event → that event is lost. So current Inline is at-least-once for crashes but not for handler
  failures; the seam fixes this via per-envelope `Complete`-on-success / `Defer`-holds.
- **Why deferred:** significant cross-cutting work; current behavior is acceptable for now and matches
  the old library.

## 1. Test framework xUnit v3; integration tests deferred
- **Date:** 2026-06-24 · **Status:** Accepted / Deferred
- **Context:** Both test projects were empty stubs with no test framework.
- **Decision:** Wire both as xUnit v3; build a starter unit suite over dependency-light logic; leave
  IntegrationTests as a single **skipped** placeholder.
- **Why:** Repo standard is xUnit v3. Integration tests need live Salesforce (sandbox) + SQL and are
  premature until the at-least-once seam and a live verification pass exist.
- **Consequences:** `dotnet test` runs the unit suite; integration is intentionally a stub.

## Wolverine alignment — divergences & gaps

Places the port strays from Wolverine's conventions or under-implements what Wolverine expects. Each is
either resolved (implemented Wolverine's way / documented) or open. Add to this list whenever a new one
is observed.

_Conformance pass 2026-06-30: audited `IListener`, `Endpoint`, and `TransportBase` against the base
contracts + Kafka/ASB. The port is largely conformant; findings below._

- **Hand-rolled listener config** — the port wrote a bespoke fluent class instead of deriving from
  `ListenerConfiguration<,>`. → **Resolved** (now derives — #5).
- **Inherited serializer/encryption knobs are inert** — Wolverine assumes its serialization pipeline; we
  bypass it by deserializing Avro ourselves. → **Superseded (Phase 3)** — option b now routes inbound
  through Wolverine's pipeline, so those knobs are *live*: `DefaultSerializer` is moot (our content-type
  serializer is registered), and the encryption gate is dormant unless a consumer calls `RequireEncryption`
  on a SF listener — which would now dead-letter every event (don't). Was #7.
- **Config lives off-endpoint, not on it** — Wolverine reference endpoints carry per-endpoint tuning on the
  endpoint (`KafkaTopic.CommitMode`/`ConsumerConfig`/`NativeDeadLetterQueueEnabled`, …); ours puts all
  tuning on the global `SubscriberComponentsSettings` singleton, so `SalesforceEndpoint` carries only
  `Kind`/`Resource`/`MessageType` and there's no per-endpoint override (e.g. per-topic
  `StartFromEarliest`/`FetchCount`). → **Open** (reshape toward Kafka's per-endpoint config). **Stipulation
  (user):** the reshape must drop `SubscriberComponentsSettings` as a *public, Options-configured* type —
  move the defaults onto `SalesforceEndpoint` (and/or a non-public defaults type), not an exposed options class.
  → **Resolved (Phase 4)** — `SubscriberComponentsSettings` is now `internal` (effective per-listener
  settings); `UseSalesforcePubSub(Uri? pubSubUri)` + fluent `TokenCacheDuration` replace the `Action<>`
  config; per-endpoint `FetchCount`/`FetchTimeout`/`StartFromEarliest` overrides live on
  `SalesforceEndpoint` with fluent setters on `SalesforceListenerConfiguration`, merged into an effective
  instance in `BuildListenerAsync`.
- **Envelope is under-populated** — the listener sets only `Message`/`TopicName`/`Offset`. Most important:
  **`Id` is not set deterministically**, so Wolverine assigns a fresh `Guid` per receive and a *redelivered*
  Salesforce event can't be deduped — derive `envelope.Id` from the Salesforce event id
  (`consumerEvent.Event.Id`/EventUuid; confirm exact field). Pairs with #2 — at-least-once needs a stable
  id for inbox idempotency. Minor parity: set `SentAt` from the event `CreatedDate` (telemetry) and the
  `MessageType` string (Kafka sets it). → **Resolved (Phase 1)** — `envelope.Id` via
  `SalesforceListener.ResolveEnvelopeId` (`consumerEvent.Event.Id` guid passthrough, else a deterministic
  guid; resource+replayId fallback), `SentAt` from `PlatformEvent.CreatedDate`, `MessageType` via
  `ToMessageTypeName()`.
- **`CompleteAsync`/`DeferAsync` are no-ops** — Wolverine's `IListener` contract expects per-envelope
  ack/defer; we commit replay at the batch level in the consume loop instead. The most significant
  under-implementation of what Wolverine expects. → **Resolved (Phase 2)** — wired to the
  `ReplayCommitTracker` watermark (Complete advances, Defer holds); Inline at-least-once (#2).
- **`ReplyEndpoint()` returned a listener** — `TransportBase`'s default advertised our listen-only endpoint
  as a request/reply target, but we can't send. → **Resolved** (overridden to return `null`; a listen-only
  transport has no reply target — every sendable transport overrides this with its real one).
- **Batch receive overload unused** — Wolverine's `IReceiver` offers `ReceivedAsync(Envelope[])`; we feed
  one envelope at a time. → **Deferred** (#6) — and it matches Kafka, which also dispatches singly.
- **No `Durable` (inbox) mode → no at-least-once *with parallelism*** — → **Resolved (#17)**:
  `supportsMode` allows Durable; the schema-on-recovery gap is closed by the auth-hardened
  `IAsyncMessageSerializer` fetch-on-miss + eager pre-warm; the replay id persists via header; verified
  live (restart-recovery, durable DLQ). Historical context below. `supportsMode` previously allowed only
  Inline/BufferedInMemory. The Wolverine-idiomatic way to get at-least-once *and* throughput is the
  **durable inbox** (`EndpointMode.Durable`): "Complete" means *persisted to the inbox* (in order), and
  the durability agent provides recovery + dedup — exactly how Kafka's `ProcessConcurrentlyByKey` works.
  Mostly **free from Wolverine** once a message store is configured (SQL Server / Postgres-Marten / EF +
  the `WolverineFx.*` package; tables auto-provisioned) — that store is the consumer-side infra.
  **Depends on #2** (verified in `DurableReceiver`): it persists to the inbox (`StoreIncomingAsync`) and
  *then* calls `listener.CompleteAsync` (`:518`/`:663`); `ReceivedAsync` returns *before* the persist, so
  our current batch-level `AcknowledgeAsync`-after-dispatch is **premature** in Durable (it would commit
  replay before durability). The only correct commit signal is `CompleteAsync` (post-persist in Durable,
  post-handler in Inline) — i.e. the #2 seam. So Durable can't be done correctly until #2 lands; after it,
  the remaining transport work is small: allow `Durable` in `supportsMode` + the **deterministic envelope
  `Id`** (inbox dedups by it). NB: low-water-marking on **BufferedInMemory** is *not* a path — it acks at
  receipt. → **Open / aspirational** (future; **built on #2**, not independent of it).
  - **Store decision: `WolverineFx.SqlServer`** (matches the stack). Parked pending live testing.
  - **Open gap — schema availability on restart-recovery (revisit after testing):** the durable inbox
    persists the envelope's raw `Data` (Avro) + headers; on a fresh-process restart the durability agent
    re-runs persisted envelopes through the pipeline → our **sync** `SalesforceAvroSerializer` reads the
    schema from the **in-memory** cache, which is empty on restart (the listener pre-fetches at receive,
    but recovery bypasses the listener). So recovered events would **dead-letter** — Durable wouldn't
    survive a restart, defeating its purpose. The hot path is unaffected (listener pre-fetch → cache hit).
    Candidate fixes to weigh after testing: (A) make the serializer `IAsyncMessageSerializer` — cache-hit
    fast path (hot path keeps auth-in-loop) + async schema fetch on miss (recovery); (B) persist the
    schema JSON in an envelope header (self-contained, storage bloat per event); (C) a durable
    schema-by-id cache/table (compact, more infra). Leaning A. **Do not implement until live testing
    informs the choice** (per user, 2026-06-30). **Co-design with #14 (custom channels):** both depend on
    schema-by-id availability outside the listener pre-fetch, so pick one schema strategy that serves
    single-topic decode, multi-type channel type-resolution, and Durable recovery — don't solve this in
    isolation.
- **No sender (listen-only)** — `SalesforceEndpoint.CreateSender` throws. Confirmed **safe**:
  `AutoStartSendingAgent()` is false for a pure listener (no `Subscriptions`), so Wolverine never calls
  `StartSending`/`CreateSender`; only reachable if a consumer publishes to an `sfpubsub://` URI (throws
  clearly). → **Intentional / verified**.
- **Owns its reconnect loop + per-attempt transport factory** — `SalesforceListener` runs the
  connect/process/backoff/reconnect loop and `_transportFactory()` yields a *fresh*
  `ISubscriptionTransport` per attempt (disposed via `using`), rather than Kafka's single long-lived
  auto-reconnecting consumer. Driven by single-use gRPC duplex streams. A single reusable transport would
  read more Kafka-like and shed a listener ctor param, **but** the lifted `TopicTransport`/MES transports
  are written single-use and already **well-tested that way**; reshaping them would change
  `ConnectAsync`/`Dispose` lifecycle semantics on validated code for a stylistic gain. → **Intentional —
  kept** (existing test coverage outweighs the Kafka-shape cleanup; do not refactor without re-validating).
- **`findEndpointByUri` throws on an unknown URI** (Kafka creates on demand) — fine for listen-only, where
  endpoints exist only from `ListenTo…` config. → **Intentional**.
- **No diagnostics surface** — `DescribeEndpoint()` (sanitized broker host) and a listener health snapshot
  (Kafka's `ReceiveLoopStatus`/`IReportReceiveLoopHealth`, GH-3236). → **Blocked (Phase 6 attempted, then
  reverted)** — both APIs are **post-6.12.0**: `Endpoint.DescribeEndpoint` (virtual) and
  `IReportReceiveLoopHealth`/`ReceiveLoopStatus` don't exist in WolverineFx **6.12.0** (the local clone is
  `main`, ahead of the pinned package). Deferred until a WolverineFx upgrade; not worth upgrading for
  optional diagnostics alone.

- **Stop/Dispose semantics vs the ListeningAgent's stop→rebuild lifecycle** — traced against the
  **V6.12.0 tag** (2026-07-03): Wolverine never restarts a listener *instance*; every stop path ends in
  `DisposeAsync` + `Listener = null`, and restart is always a fresh `Endpoint.BuildListenerAsync` with the
  *receiver* reused. Three live paths: (1) `StopAndDrainAsync` (normal stop / `PauseAsync` /
  `PauseForInboxRecoveryAsync` — the latter fires for our **Durable** mode on an inbox DB outage):
  `StopAsync` → latch → `receiver.DrainAsync()` → `DisposeAsync` — so completions flow into the
  stopped-but-undisposed listener during the drain; (2) `MarkAsTooBusyAndStopReceivingAsync`
  (backpressure; applies to Buffered/Durable): `StopAsync` → `DisposeAsync` **with no drain** — the
  receiver's queue keeps processing and completions arrive on an already-disposed listener, then
  `StartAsync` rebuilds when the queue drains; (3) normal shutdown. The real contract is therefore:
  StopAsync = stop fetching; the instance must *absorb* post-stop completions; the endpoint must be
  indefinitely re-buildable. **Status:** recreatability ✓ (`BuildListenerAsync` constructs everything
  per call; singletons are rebuild-safe; resume comes from the repo / server checkpoint). Our
  `StopAsync` conflates stop with teardown (flush → cancel → loop exit kills the stream), which costs
  nothing on correctness: post-stop completions advance the in-memory tracker harmlessly, topic commits
  need no stream (repository write), `DisposeAsync`'s re-entrant flush catches the drained tail for
  topic, and MES's drained tail degrades to bounded redelivery. **Open gap found:** in the no-drain
  backpressure path the *old* disposed listener's queue completions keep committing to the same
  repository row **while the replacement listener commits newer positions** — our SQL upsert is not
  monotonic, so a late stale commit can regress `ReplayId` (→ duplicates on a later cold start; never
  loss). Candidate fixes: a monotonic guard on the commit path, or null `_currentTransport` at dispose
  so a dead listener loses write authority (trades away the beneficial drain-window commits). →
  **Resolved (#22)** — commit authority is revoked at dispose (preserving drain-window commits) and the
  tracker's write gate drops strictly-older positions; the race is deterministically pinned in the new
  listener unit harness and the Backpressure fact's monotonicity observation is now a hard assertion.

## Cleanups / tech-debt

Non-conformance, code-quality items — places to make the implementation **read** more like Wolverine's
reference transports (Kafka primary), not just behave like one. Tackle in an update pass.

- **The two gRPC transport classes are live-suite-verified only — by choice.**
  `ClientManagedReplayTransport` / `ManagedEventSubscriptionTransport` are thin protocol adapters over
  single-use duplex streams; a unit facsimile means emulating Pub/Sub semantics (duplex fetch/commit
  interleaving, trailers, replay-id validation, keep-alive cadence) — an emulator that would itself need
  live verification. Everything above them IS unit-covered: the listener runs against a scripted
  `ISubscriptionTransport` (deterministic interleavings — see #22's harness) and the tracker is pinned
  directly, so the transports carry only the wire mapping, which the 16-fact live suite exercises for
  both kinds. Revisit only if a maintained Pub/Sub API emulator appears or CI gains live credentials.
  → **Accepted** (2026-07-06; concurred by two independent external reviews' triage).

- **`SalesforceListener` construction is service-locator-ish** — `SalesforceEndpoint.BuildListenerAsync`
  does five `runtime.Services.GetRequiredService<…>()` calls and threads the results into an 11-arg
  constructor. Manual `new` in `BuildListenerAsync` is itself fine and Wolverine-idiomatic (Kafka `new`s
  its listener too), but the shape is heavier than Kafka's. Make it more Kafka-like:
  `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<SalesforceListener>(runtime.Services, <contextual args>)` so DI fills
  the service params (deserializer, settings, backoff, token provider, logger), and/or pass the
  `SalesforceEndpoint` in and read `Resource`/`MessageType`/`Uri` off it to shrink the param list.
  Internal-only; no behavior or public-surface change. (Observed during the runtime-implementation review.)
  → **Resolved (Phase 2)** via `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance` (DI fills the service params).
- **Deserialize through Wolverine's serializer pipeline, keeping Avro (option "b")** — today the listener
  Avro-decodes and sets `envelope.Message` directly (the in-process pattern), bypassing Wolverine's
  serializer (#7). Candidate: set `envelope.Data` = raw Avro bytes + a content-type + a schema-id header,
  and register a **sync** custom `IMessageSerializer` that reads the (already-cached) schema and
  Avro-decodes to the type — mirroring how Confluent Schema-Registry resolves-then-decodes. Reactivates
  the serializer/encryption pipeline and makes us read like a broker transport (`Data`-based) instead of
  the local/in-process shape. **Hard constraint:** the **async schema lookup must stay in the transport
  consume loop** (the listener pre-fetches/ensures-cached before handoff), NOT in the serializer — so a
  revoked/expired-token `GetSchema` failure still surfaces to the reconnect loop and triggers the
  token-invalidate. Moving the fetch into the (pipeline-run) serializer would break that auth recovery.
  → **Resolved (Phase 3)** — `SalesforceAvroSerializer` (sync, registered on the endpoint by content-type)
  decodes from the cached schema and stamps `ReplayId`/`SentAt`; the listener sets `Data` + content-type +
  `sfdc-schema-id` header and pre-fetches the schema in the loop (auth recovery preserved). The now-dead
  `PlatformEventDeserializer`/`EventMessage`/`IEventDeserializer` were removed.

## Inherited from the original port — pending ratification

These were decided by the earlier porting session, not by us. Listed here to be reviewed and either
ratified into a numbered entry above or revisited:

- **net10.0 only** — WolverineFx 6.x dropped net8 (forced, not really a choice).
- **Listen-only** — publishing is a REST POST, out of scope for this transport.
- **CDC out of scope** — Platform Events first; CDC deferred.
- **Auth mirrors an internal Salesforce REST client** — its own `SalesforceTokenClient`, not a
  deprecated shared authentication package.
- **Folder-based namespaces; public event base types in `Wolverine.SalesforcePubSub.Events`.**
- **`UseWolverine` over `AddWolverine`** — host-builder integration + reliable handler assembly scanning.
